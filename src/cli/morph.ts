# Git branching rules
- The target branch is the the branch the completed work will finally be merged into
- The working branch is your main branch for development, which will branch from the target branch.
- You must perform all development work on temporary branches from your working branch. When a temporary branch is compiling and all the tests passing, then you can merge it into the working branch.
`;

	// - Use DeepThink when generating a detailed implementation plan for the code editing agent.
	// - Use DeepThink, along with online research with Perplexity if relevant, when stuck on compile/test errors.

# High-level workflow guidance

For implementing large features or complex functionality:
Use a bottom-up, dependency-first approach. Break down the feature into its dependency hierarchy and identify the leaf nodes (components with no dependencies).
Implement from the foundation up by: 
1) Building the most primitive functions/classes first,
2) Writing comprehensive tests for each component,
3) Verifying each component works in isolation before proceeding,
4) Progressively building more complex functionality on top of proven, working components.
Never implement higher-level components until their dependencies are solid and tested.
This ensures you're building on a stable foundation rather than debugging interconnected failures later

For debugging issues and resolving problems:
Take a systematic, evidence-based approach to isolate the root cause. Start by reproducing the issue consistently, then narrow down the problem scope by: 
1) Adding targeted logging and print statements at key decision points, 
2) Writing focused unit tests that isolate the suspected problematic components, 
3) Examining inputs, outputs, and state at each step of the failing execution path. 
Avoid making assumptions about where the bug is - let the evidence guide you. 
Once you've identified the root cause, fix it at the source rather than applying band-aid solutions, then add regression tests to prevent the issue from recurring.

Assume tests are required for functionality. Follow best practices of:
- Preferring state testing instead of interaction testing. 
- Prefer test doubles over mocks. 
- High fidelity tests are preferred over low fidelity tests.
- Focus on testing system/user behaviours
- Making test non-brittle to code changes, e.g. avoid using specific implementation details in the tests and asserting on copied string values.

# General function calling guidelines for code tasks

- Use FileSystemTree_collapseFolder to hide unrelated folders for the current task to minimize token usage.
- Use the CodeFunctions_findRelevantFiles to to quickly get an initial file list to add to the LiveFiles 
- Use LiveFile to view the files. These will always show the current file contents after functions/agents modifies it.
- Use LiveFiles to understand the current state of the code base and to determine what needs to be done next.
- After verifying changes from the code editing agent by viewing file contents with LiveFiles (an optionally the diff), then add a completed item to the plan.
- Minimize the files loaded with LiveFiles to the essentials to reduce LLM token costs. Remove files from LiveFiles no longer required.
- Implement this functionality in multiple small pieces through multiple calls to the code editing agent to minimize the token size of the LLM calls, and to make smaller, simpler tasks to complete at one time.
- Provide a detailed implementation plan to the code editing agent for the small set of changes to make at a time.
- If you get stuck on a step, you can provide a mock/fake implementation and make a note in memory. Then continue on to the next steps. Only request feedback if you are really stuck.
- You are working in an existing codebase. Use the CodeFunctions_queryRepository to ask questions about the codebase to ensure you are making the correct changes.
- Write tests but dont spend too long on then if you are having difficulties writing the tests. You can always add a describe.skip and we'll come back to it later.
